# NFT Marketplace

![marketplace image](./pic/marketplace.jpg)

This project is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) Marketplace built using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The marketplace allows users to create, buy, and sell unique digital assets in the form of NFTs. Each NFT represents ownership of a specific item or piece of content, and this ownership is transparently recorded on the blockchain.

## Features

- **Mint NFTs**: Users can create their own NFTs by specifying the metadata and other properties of the token.
- **Buy and Sell NFTs**: Users can list their NFTs for sale at a specified price and purchase NFTs listed by others.
- **Ownership Management**: The ownership of each NFT is tracked on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Users can transfer ownership of their NFTs to others.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahdiZarrei/nft-marketplace.git
   cd nft-marketplace
   ```

2. **Deploy contracts**:
   Use a tool like `truffle` or `remix` to deploy the Solidity contracts to the Ethereum network. Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to cover gas fees.

## Usage

After deploying the contracts, you can interact with them using a web interface or command-line tools like `web3.js` or `ethers.js`. The web interface allows users to mint new NFTs, list them for sale, and purchase NFTs from others.
